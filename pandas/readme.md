# Core Data Structures

## 1. Series

A one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding various data types such as integers, floats, or strings.

It can be thought of as a single column in a table.

---

## 2. DataFrame

A two-dimensional labeled data structure organized into rows and columns.

It is similar to:
- Excel spreadsheets  
- SQL tables  
- Structured datasets  

The DataFrame is the most commonly used structure in Pandas.
